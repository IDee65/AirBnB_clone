# AirBnB Clone Project
## Part 1 - command interpreter
### This project will entail:
* Putting in place a parent class (called `BaseModel`) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances
* Creating a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* Creating all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Placeâ€¦`) that inherit from `BaseModel`
* Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
### How to use it:
1. Start up the console by typing `./console`.
2. Type `help` to see what commands are available.

Usage and Examples:

```bash
 ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
